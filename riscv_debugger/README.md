# riscv_debugger

**riscv_debugger** is a powerful, open-source debugger tailored specifically for RISC-V architectures. It equips developers with essential debugging functionalities, facilitating the identification and resolution of issues in RISC-V applications.

## Key Features

- **Breakpoints**: Set and manage breakpoints to pause execution at specific points.
- **Step Execution**: Step through code line-by-line or instruction-by-instruction.
- **Variable Inspection**: Inspect and modify variables in real-time.
- **Memory Examination**: View and edit memory contents.
- **Instruction Tracing**: (Coming Soon) Trace the execution of instructions for detailed analysis.
- **Live Code Profiling**: (Coming Soon) Profile code performance in real-time to identify bottlenecks.
- **Code-Coverage Analysis**: (Coming Soon) Analyze code coverage to ensure thorough testing.

## Benefits

- **Ease of Use**: Intuitive interface that simplifies the debugging process.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing RISC-V development environments.
- **Performance**: Optimized for speed and efficiency, ensuring minimal impact on the target system.
- **Community-Driven**: Open-source project with contributions from the RISC-V community.
