## üìù Introduction
`riscv_ai_infer` is a tool designed to perform AI model inference on **RISC-V hardware**. Leveraging Rust‚Äôs performance and safety guarantees, this engine is optimized for low-power, resource-constrained devices, making it ideal for edge computing and IoT applications.

## ‚ú® Features
- Efficient AI inference using Rust and `nalgebra`.
- Optimized for RISC-V architecture.
- Caching system to reduce redundant API calls.
- Terminal-based user interface for quick insights.
- Flexible configuration options.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
First, ensure you have the Rust toolchain installed. Then, clone this repository and build the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bensatlantik/riscv_ai_infer.git
cd riscv_ai_infer
cargo build --release
```
## Usage
You can run the program directly using:
```bash
cargo run
```
## Command-Line Arguments (Optional)
To specify a crate for which you want to fetch statistics:
```bash
cargo run -- <crate_name>
```
## Configuration
The tool supports a configuration file named config.toml. This is optional and will be skipped if not present.
```toml
# Example config.toml
api_key = ""

```
## Example Output
```yaml
