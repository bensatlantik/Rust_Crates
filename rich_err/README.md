# rich_err

**rich_err** is a Rust library designed to simplify and enrich error handling by adding structured and meaningful context to errors. It provides a developer-friendly API for consistent and detailed error reporting, making debugging and error analysis more efficient.

## Features
- **Rich Error Context**: Easily add and format detailed context to errors for improved debugging.
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: Designed with performance in mind, adding context without unnecessary overhead.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple and intuitive API for managing error contexts.

## Getting Started
To include `rich_err` in your project, add the following line to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rich_err = "0.1.0"
```
## Example Usage
Here's a basic example demonstrating how to use rich_err:

```rust

use rich_err::RichError;

fn main() {
    let error = RichError::new("An error occurred")
        .with_context("Failed to open file")
        .with_context("Permission denied");

    println!("{}", error.to_string_with_context());
}
```
## Output:
An error occurred Context: Failed to open file Context: Permission denied
