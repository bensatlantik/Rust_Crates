# rust_gui_kit

**rust_gui_kit** is a cross-platform graphical user interface (GUI) framework for Rust. This library aims to simplify the creation of desktop applications that run smoothly on Windows, macOS, and Linux. With a simple API, rust_gui_kit provides developers with a basic platform on which to build GUIs.

### Installation

Add `rust_gui_kit` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rust_gui_kit = "0.1.0"
```
## Usage

## Examples
To run an example, use:
``` bash
cargo run --example example_name
```
Here is a simple example to get you started:
```rust
use rust_gui_kit::{window::Window, button::Button};

fn main() {
    // Initialize the library (if needed)
    rust_gui_kit::initialize();

    // Create a new window
    let window = Window::new("Hello, GUI!", 800, 600);
    window.show();

    // Create a new button
    let button = Button::new("Click Me");
    button.on_click(|| {
        println!("Button was clicked!");
    });
}
```
## Contributing
I am an avid open-source software advocate and contributor. I am not always available to collaborate or indefinitely maintain these libraries, but hope they prove useful in your projects. Please feel free to fork my repositories - use and improve them as you see fit. 

This rust_gui_kit is a basic framework with window and button components. Add more widgets to increase functionality.
